# Migrate of nodes of type "story" from Drupal 6 to Drupal 8.
#
# This file demonstrates migration of content translated with
# the D6 'content_translation' module.
#
# Many configuration parameters are described in detail in this
# file, so it's a good starting point.

label: Hybrid base data
# Migrations can be organized into groups, one group per migration.

# Migrations can also be organized by tags, potentially many tags per

# Migration source
source:
  # Since we want to migrate nodes from Drupal 6, we need to
  # use the 'd6_node' source plugin. The plugin icomes with core's
  # 'migrate_drupal' module.
  #
  # If you need additional functionality, you can create a custom
  # plugin that extends this one. See the c11n_dog_base migration
  # for an example of that.
  plugin: d6_node
  # The type of nodes we want to migrate.
  #
  # This parameter tells the source plugin that only nodes of
  # type 'story' are to be read from the Drupal 6 database.
  node_type: story
  # Specify source database.
  #
  # The database settings need to be defined in the global
  # $databases variable. See the sample 'settings.local.php'
  # file provided in the project to learn how to add these
  # settings. For this example, the settings are in
  # $databases['drupal_6'].
  key: drupal_6
  # Constant values for the migration.
  constants:
    node_article: article
    body_format: full_html
# Migration destination
destination:
  # Since we want to create 'node' entities from the source data,
  # we specify 'entity:node' as the destination plugin.
  plugin: 'entity:node'
# Migration processes
# This does the mapping between source fields and destination fields.
process:
  # The type of node we wish to create, in this case 'article'.
  type: constants/node_article
  # Destination node language.
  langcode: language
  # The body is a special case, since it has both a value and a format.
  # We assign body data as the value, and 'full_html' as the format.
  'body/value': body
  'body/format': constants/body_format
  # Some other properties which we migrate as-is.
